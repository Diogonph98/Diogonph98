- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Diogonph98.
- ðŸ‘€ At the moment (March 2021) I'm on my last semester of the Bachelor in Physics, at FCUL (Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa).
- ðŸŒ± I'm constantly learning new techniques for data anlysis, in particular SQL (introductory level) and Python (intermediate level), either through courses or projects (at the moment, I'm using the platform 'Datacamp' for this).


- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Linkedin through the following link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/diogo-henriques-a34b28182/
